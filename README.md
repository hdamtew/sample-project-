##### 2.Introduction 
###### Problem Statment: What is the question or problem you aim to address with the data?
###### Objecitves: why is the analysis being performed, and what do you hope to discover or demonstrate through the histogram?
###### Improtance of the stury: whys is this analysis relevant ? who benefits from the results 

##### 3.Abstract 

###### this project will show the density plot of data set 
###### Problem statment : what is the question or problem you aim to address with the data?
###### Objective: why is the analysis beiing performed, and what do you hope to discover or demonstrate through the histogram? 
###### Importance of the study: why is this analysis relevant? who benefits from the results?
###### Overview of the Dataset: Provide a brife description of the data source, type, and key variables(e.g., numeric, catagorical, time serires).
###### Ocerview of the Dataset: Provide a brief description of the data sourc

##### 4. Methodology 

###### Data Collection: How was the data collectedor sources? Is it from a survye. experiment. sensor readings, etc,?
###### Any data preprocessing steps(e.g., cleaning, filtering, or transforming data)
###### Histogram Construction: Ezplain how the hsitogram is created.
###### Include details such as bin size (number of bins), bin width, and how you chose these parameters.
###### What software/tools were used (e.g., Python Libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or R)?
###### Statistical Techniques: Any stastical tests or measures(e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, skewness) used to summarize or analayze the data.

##### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
###### Intial Observation: Describe the key features of the data as seen from the histogram. 
###### Distribution Type : Is the data normally distributed, skewed, bimodal, etc?
###### Outliners: Any noticeable outliers or anomalies in the data.
###### Comparision: If appllicable, compare the histogram across different groups or sub-datasets.
##### Results
###### Histogram Visualization:
###### Perhaps the most popular graphical summary of quantitative variables: data are first catagorized into classes of equal width and then frequencies abd relative frequencies are calculated.

Box plot visualuazation:
the median, minimum, Maximum, 1st and 3rd quartiles are used to create box plot 

Include one or more histograms that show the distribution of the data.
Use appropriate labeling (e.g., axis titles, chart title, legends).
Summary of Key Insights:
Discuss the shape, spread, and central tendencies of the data.
Include any patterns or trends identified.
Any unexpected findings or insights from the data distribution.
Statistical Summary:
Provide key statistical measures (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation) and discuss their relevance.
7. Discussion
Interpretation of Results: Discuss what the histogram reveals about the data in relation to the initial problem statement.
Limitations: Any limitations of the analysis or data, such as small sample size, data quality issues, or binning choices.
Implications: How the findings could be used in practice or what further analysis could be conducted.
8. Conclusion
Summarize the main findings and their significance.
If applicable, suggest next steps for further analysis or research.
Reflect on the effectiveness of the histogram as a tool for understanding the data.
9. References
List any books, papers, websites, or tools referenced during the project. Use a consistent citation style (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago).
10. Appendices (if needed)
Additional Visualizations: Any supplementary charts or tables.
Code: Include relevant snippets of the code used to create the histogram, especially if it's part of the methodology.
Data Dictionary: If the dataset has many variables, a data dictionary could help explain them.
Supplementary Tables: Detailed tables of statistical summaries or raw data if necessary.
